# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

# Okay, whenever I see something like K points or something that has to do with a param K, intuition leads to me to think heaps.

# So in this case, we're trying to find the k closts points to the origin, so we can use a heap to maintain those points
